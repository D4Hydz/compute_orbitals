Hello

All the files that have been given to me are in the folder 'Code Files'

The assessment instructions are 'assessment_instructions.pdf' 
This file provides a long explanation about the problem and the files however I have written a quick guide below.

The other pdf documents are the only resources the teacher has given us in relation to using functions and objects in C++.
Essentially we have had 3 hours of lesson time to learn how to use functions and classes in C++ bearing in mind it was already a bit confusing in Python. 

Ive managed to work out how to initialise the class and use some of the functions within it however some are showing errors and I do not know how to fix it.

As well as this I cannot really understand the instructions i.e. the header file, about how to use the classes. Im confused about why 'const' has to be used all the time.

Inside the folder 'code_files' there are files 'body.cpp' and 'body.hpp' defining a class called 'Body' which is used to store information about the planets.

The files 'vector3d.cpp', 'vector3d.hpp' define a class called 'vec' which are functions for manipulating vectors in different ways.

The file 'compute_orbitals.cpp' is the file that I have to write my functions into and run. 

The code is compiled by the command below on a bash terminal.
g++ -std=c++17 vector3d.cpp body.cpp compute_orbits.cpp -o compute_orbits

The code can be run using the command below on a bash terminal(requires 4 args) compute_orbits <input_file> <output_file> <dt> <T> <Tsave>
./compute_orbits sun_earth.csv test_case.csv 1e-3 1 1
 
The compute_orbits file has comments to show where I am supposed to write the code.
The code should compile without any errors as long as it is unchanged from when I sent it.
The first problem I have run into is that I cannot assign a value to a variable in the class 'body'

Line 120
// Sets the gpe value to the system 1. Doesnt work?
    //system[1].set_gpe(gpe);
    //system[0].set_gpe(gpe);
	
My understanding is that this code should assign the variable 'gpe' to the object of system[1] and system[2] however it gives an error.
To test it yourself just uncomment the lines of code. 

If theres anything else you want then text for the fastest response.

Thanks
